## AI Supercomputers

Condor Galaxy (CG), the supercomputer built by G42 and Cerebras, is the simplest and fastest way to build AI models in the cloud. With over 16 ExaFLOPs of AI compute, Condor Galaxy trains the most demanding models in hours rather than days. The terabyte scale MemoryX system natively accommodates 100 billion+ parameter models, making large scale training simple and efficient.

| Cluster  | ExaFLOPs | Systems  | Memory |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | ------ |
| CG1      | 4        | 64 CS-2s | 82 TB  |
| CG2      | 4        | 64 CS-2s | 82 TB  |
| CG3      | 8        | 64 CS-3s | 108 TB |
